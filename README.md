Prediction of temperature of a city from time-series data using ARIMA and LSTM

It is about comparing ARIMA and RNN(LSTM) models in predicting temperature of a city. The data "climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data" is available in kaggle. The experiments are done by considering the data in three different ways first-500, first-1000 and, all-samples. Then the outcomes of the models are compared.
